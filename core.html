                                This is an optional method of startup class. It can be used to configure the services that are used by the application. This method calls first when the application is requested for the first time. Using this method, we can add the services to the DI container, so services are available as a dependency in controller constructor.

                            <p>
                                The Configure method is used to specify how the ASP.NET application will respond to HTTP requests. The request pipeline is configured by adding middleware components to an IApplicationBuilder instance that is provided by dependency injection. There are some built-in middlewares for error handling, authentication, routing, session and diagnostic purpose. Highlighted lines in below code, are built-in Middleware with ASP.NET Core 1.0.

                            <p>
                                Kestrel is a cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core based on libuv, a cross-platform asynchronous I/O library. Kestrel is the web server that is included by default in ASP.NET Core new project templates. If your application accepts requests only from an internal network, you can use Kestrel by itself.

                                If you expose your application to the Internet, you must use IIS, Nginx, or Apache as a reverse proxy server. A reverse proxy server receives HTTP requests from the Internet and forwards them to Kestrel after some preliminary handling. The most important reason for using a reverse proxy for edge deployments (exposed to traffic from the Internet) is security. Kestrel is relatively new and does not yet have a full complement of defenses against attacks.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>What is WebListener?</h4>
                            <p>
                                ASP.NET Core ships two server implementations Kestral and WebListener. WebListener is also a web server for ASP.NET Core that runs only on Windows. It’s built on the Http.Sys kernel mode driver. WebListener is an alternative to Kestrel that can be used for direct connection to the Internet without relying on IIS as a reverse proxy server.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>What is ASP.NET Core Module (ANCM)?</h4>
                            <p>
                                ASP.NET Core Module (ANCM) lets you run ASP.NET Core applications behind IIS and it works only with Kestrel; it isn’t compatible with WebListener. ANCM is a native IIS module that hooks into the IIS pipeline and redirects traffic to the backend ASP.NET Core application. ASP.NET Core applications run in a process separate from the IIS worker process, ANCM also does process management. ANCM starts the process for the ASP.NET Core application when the first request comes in and restarts it when it crashes. In short, it sits in IIS and routes the request for ASP.NET Core application to Kestral.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <h4>What is a Host and what’s the importance of Host in ASP.NET Core application?</h4>
                            <p>
                                ASP.NET Core apps require a host in which to execute. The host is responsible for application startup and lifetime management. Other responsibility of host’s includes ensuring the application’s services and the server are available and properly configured. Don’t confuse yourself with a Server. The host is responsible for starting the app and its management, where the server is responsible for accepting HTTP requests. The host is configured to use a particular server; the server is unaware of its host.

                                The host is typically created using an instance of a WebHostBuilder, which builds and returns a WebHost instance. The WebHost references the server that will handle requests.

                            <h4>What is the role of IHostingEnvironment interface in ASP.NET Core?</h4>
                            <p>
                                ASP.NET Core offers an interface named IHostingEnvironment, allows you to programmatically retrieve the current environment so you can have an environment-specific behaviour. By default, ASP.NET Core has 3 environments Development, Staging, and Production. Previously, the developers have to build the application differently for each environment (Staging, UAT, Production) due to dependency on config file sections and the preprocessor directive applicable at compile time. ASP.NET Core takes a different approach and uses IHostingEnvironment to retrieve the current environment. You can also define a custom environment like QA or UAT.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>What is the use of UseIISIntegration?</h4>
                            <p>
                                This tells ASP.NET that IIS will be working as a reverse proxy in front of Kestrel. As if you expose your application to the Internet, you must use IIS, Nginx, or Apache as a reverse proxy server. When you wish to deploy your ASP.NET Core application on windows, you need to tell ASP.NET Core Host to use IIS integration.
                                UseKestrel and UseIISIntegration must be used in conjunction as UseKestrel creates the web server and hosts the code. UseIISIntegration specifies IIS as the reverse proxy server.
                                <pre>
var host = new WebHostBuilder()
         .UseKestrel()
         .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
         .UseIISIntegration()
         .UseStartup<Startup>()
         .Build();

                            <p>
                                In ASP.NET Core, all the static resources, such as CSS, JavaScript, and image files are kept under the wwwroot folder (default). You can also change the name of this folder.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                This json file holds project specific settings associated with each debug profile, Visual Studio is configured to use to launch the application, including any environment variables that should be used. You can define framework for your project for compilation and debugging for specific profiles. This file is placed in Properties folder.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As mentioned on Wikipedia “Environment variables are a set of dynamic named values that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. They are part of the environment in which a process runs.” So similarly, there are various environment variables present in ASP.NET 5 which can be set that will affect various parts of the runtime. You can find the complete list here. But for this post, we are interested in ASPNET_ENV variable. This variable actually defines the environment the application is currently running in. There are 3 values are used by convention: Development, Staging, and Production. We are also allowed to set any value which we want.

                                And if you see Startup.cs class code, you will see these values are used.

                            <p>It defines how the application will respond to each HTTP request. We can configure the request pipeline by configuring the middleware. It accepts IApplicationBuilder as a parameter and also it has two optional parameters: IHostingEnvironment and ILoggerFactory. Using this method, we can configure built-in <a href="https://www.dotnettricks.com/learn/aspnetcore/middleware-custom-pipeline" target="_blank">middleware</a> such as routing, authentication, session, etc. as well as third-party middleware.</p>

                            <h4>What is middleware?</h4>
                            <p>It is software which is injected into the application pipeline to handle request and responses. They are just like chained to each other and form as a pipeline. The incoming requests are passes through this pipeline where all middleware is configured, and middleware can perform some action on the request before passes it to the next middleware. Same as for the responses, they are also passing through the middleware but in reverse order.</p>

                            <p>We can use both the methods in Configure methods of startup class. Both are used to add middleware delegate to the application request pipeline. The middleware adds using IApplicationBuilder.Use may call the next middleware in the pipeline whereas the middleware adds using IApplicationBuilder.Run method never calls the subsequent ore next middleware. After IApplicationBuilder.Run method, system stop adding middleware in request pipeline.</p>

                            <p>It is used for branching the pipeline. It branches the ASP.NET Core pipeline based on request path matching. If request path starts with the given path, middleware on to that branch will execute.</p><pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums">

                            <p>Routing is functionality that map incoming request to the route handler. The route can have values (extract them from URL) that used to process the request. Using the route, routing can find route handler based on URL. All the routes are registered when the application is started. There are two types of <a href="https://www.dotnettricks.com/learn/aspnetcore/routing" target="_blank">routing</a> supported by ASP.NET Core</p>

                            <p>The Routing uses routes for map incoming request with route handler and Generate URL that used in response. Mostly, the application having a single collection of routes and this collection are used for the process the request. The RouteAsync method is used to map incoming request (that match the URL) with available in route collection.</p>

                            <p>It is a feature provided by Razor view engine that enables us to write server-side code to create and render the HTML element in view (Razor). The tag-helper is C# classes that used to generate the view by adding the HTML element. The functionality of tag helper is very similar to HTML helper of ASP.NET MVC.</p><pre class="prettyprint lang-html linenums"> Example:

                            <p>This is a new feature introduced in ASP.NET Core 2.0. It follows a page-centric development model just like ASP.NET web forms. It supports all the feature of ASP.NET Core.</p><b>Example</b><pre class="prettyprint lang-html linenums"> @page 
 &lt;h1&gt; Hello, Book Reader!&lt;/h1&gt; 
 &lt;h4&gt; This is Razor Pages &lt;/h4&gt;
</pre>
                            <p>The Razor pages start with the @page directive. This directive handle request directly without passing through the controller. The Razor pages may have code behind file, but it is not really code-behind file. It is class inherited from PageModel class.</p>

By default, it only binds the properties only with non-GET verbs. we need to set SupportsGet property to true to bind a property on getting request.</p><b>Example</b><pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> public class Test1Model : PageModel

                            <p><b>Step 1:</b> Create the service</p><pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> public interface IHelloWorldService
 {
 string SaysHello();
 }
 
 public class HelloWorldService: IHelloWorldService
 {
 public string SaysHello()
 {
 return "Hello ";
 }
 }
</pre>
                            <p><b>Step 2: </b>Add this service to Service container (service can either added by singleton, transient or scoped)</p><pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)

 …
 …

                            <h4>How to specify service lifetime for register service that added as a dependency?</h4>
                            <p>ASP.NET Core allows us to specify the lifetime for registered services. The service instance gets disposed of automatically based on a specified lifetime. So, we do not care about the cleaning these dependencies, it will take care by ASP.NET Core framework. There is three type of lifetimes.</p>
                            <h3>Singleton</h3>
                            <p>ASP.NET Core will create and share a single instance of the service through the application life. The service can be added as a singleton using AddSingleton method of IServiceCollection. ASP.NET Core creates service instance at the time of registration and subsequence request use this service instance. Here, we do not require to implement Singleton design pattern and single instance maintained by the ASP.NET Core itself.</p><b>Example</b><pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> services.AddSingleton&lt;IHelloWorldService, HelloWorldService&gt;();
</pre>
                            <h3>Transient</h3>
                            <p>ASP.NET Core will create and share an instance of the service every time to the application when we ask for it. The service can be added as Transient using AddTransient method of IServiceCollection. This lifetime can be used in stateless service. It is a way to add lightweight service.</p><b>Example</b><pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums"> services.AddTransient&lt;IHelloWorldService, HelloWorldService&gt;();
</pre>
                            <h3>Scoped</h3>
                            <p>ASP.NET Core will create and share an instance of the service per request to the application. It means that a single instance of service available per request. It will create a new instance in the new request. The service can be added as scoped using an AddScoped method of IServiceCollection. We need to take care while, service registered via Scoped in middleware and inject the service in the Invoke or InvokeAsync methods. If we inject dependency via the constructor, it behaves like singleton object.</p><pre class="prettyprint lang-c linenums">services.AddScoped&lt;IHelloWorldService, HelloWorldService&gt;();
